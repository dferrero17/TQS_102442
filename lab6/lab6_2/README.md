There are **29 lines to cover** and **6 uncovered lines**. There are also **60 conditions to cover** and **57 uncovered conditions**.

## Lines to cover

The lines to cover are the lines that are not covered by the tests and that should be covered so the project could be "perfect". However, in real-world some lines are not covered by tests, and this is completely normal. Those lines that usually are not covered are also displayed under "lines to cover".

## Uncovered lines

The uncovered lines are lines in the code that should be covered by the tests but are not covered for some reason.

## Conditions to cover vs Uncovered Conditions

This follows the same principle as the Lines to cover vs Uncovered lines.
